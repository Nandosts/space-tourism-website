## My process

### Built with

- Yarn
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Typescript
- [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - JS library

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn install`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn run dev -- --open
```

### What I learned

The most important thing on my vision was svelte-kit, it's a huge and useful tool, with multiple packages to improve the build and change the coding experience. Really interesting and worth. But I enjoyed a lot applying some little animations and stylization's, besides creating a beautiful site.

## Acknowledgments

I started learning Svelte on a company named VLGI, and this gave me this first step to start studies and challenges like this one. It's also what inspired me to try svelte-kit at this project.
